A python script to add timezone definitions to a ICS file for it to be compatible e.g. with Mac Calendar or outlook.com calendar. Additionally you can also add reminders to the ICS file.

Original ICS file is "example.ics"

File "example_Fixed.ics" was created with command:
	"python icsfix.py example.ics 60" 

That command added timezone definitions for Europe/Helsinki and additionally also added a reminder 60 minutes before each event.
